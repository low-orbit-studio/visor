Rebalance `SEMANTIC_TEXT_MAP` so the auto-derived text scale clears WCAG AA contrast by default for any reasonable input neutral. `text-secondary` now maps to neutral 700/300 (light/dark) and `text-tertiary` to neutral 600/400 — both fixed-L shades. Previously `text-tertiary` landed on neutral 400 (L 0.65), giving ~3.5:1 contrast on white and forcing every stock theme to override the entire text scale. `text-primary` (900/50) and `text-disabled` (300/600) are unchanged. Stock themes (`neutral`) drop their defensive text overrides; `modern-minimal`, `blackout`, and `space` keep theirs as intentional brand language. Borderless dark text-secondary contrast improves from 2.96:1 to 6.77:1.
